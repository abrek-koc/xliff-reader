# xliff-reader
Read xliff 1.2 files in your browser.

Download [here](https://github.com/sybrk/xliff-reader/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Unzip the files open xliff_reader.html file in your Chrome browser.
Choose .xliff or .xlf files from your computer and click Read button. A table with the content of xliff files will be created.

If you are familiar to XML DOM and CSS Selectors, you can modify the script file to customize it per your needs.
If you want to style HTML futher, you can use bootstrap class names. Style resource is [bootstrap V5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/).

I am planning to add functionalities like Search, filter by state, show TM match info, show segment number etc.
